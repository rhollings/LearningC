// The max(x,y) function can be used to find the highest value of x and y:
cout << max(5, 10);

// And the min(x,y)
cout << min(5, 10);

// Other functions, such as sqrt (square root), round (rounds a number) and log (natural logarithm), can be found in the <cmath> header file:
// Include the cmath library
#include <cmath>

cout << sqrt(64);
cout << round(2.6);
cout << log(2);
