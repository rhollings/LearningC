C++ What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data,
while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. 
You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

C++ Classes/Objects
C++ is an object-oriented programming language.

Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".

A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

class MyClass {       // The class
  public:             // Access specifier
    int myNum;        // Attribute (int variable)
    string myString;  // Attribute (string variable)
};



class MyClass {       // The class
  public:             // Access specifier
    int myNum;        // Attribute (int variable)
    string myString;  // Attribute (string variable)
};

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;  // Create an object of MyClass

  // Access attributes and set values
  myObj.myNum = 15; 
  myObj.myString = "Some text";

  // Print attribute values
  cout << myObj.myNum << "\n";
  cout << myObj.myString;
  return 0;
}

// Class Methods
class MyClass {        // The class
  public:              // Access specifier
    void myMethod() {  // Method/function defined inside the class
      cout << "Hello World!";
    }
};

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;     // Create an object of MyClass
  myObj.myMethod();  // Call the method
  return 0;
}

// Call Outside
class MyClass {        // The class
  public:              // Access specifier
    void myMethod();   // Method/function declaration
};

// Method/function definition outside the class
void MyClass::myMethod() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
}

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;     // Create an object of MyClass
  myObj.myMethod();  // Call the method
  return 0;
}

// Constructors
/*
Constructors can also take parameters (just like regular functions), which can be useful for setting initial values for attributes.

The following class have brand, model and year attributes, and a constructor with different parameters. 
Inside the constructor we set the attributes equal to the constructor parameters (brand=x, etc).
When we call the constructor (by creating an object of the class), we pass parameters to the constructor,
which will set the value of the corresponding attributes to the same:
*/

class Car {        // The class
  public:          // Access specifier
    string brand;  // Attribute
    string model;  // Attribute
    int year;      // Attribute
    Car(string x, string y, int z) { // Constructor with parameters
      brand = x;
      model = y;
      year = z;
    }
};

int main() {
  // Create Car objects and call the constructor with different values
  Car carObj1("BMW", "X5", 1999);
  Car carObj2("Ford", "Mustang", 1969);

  // Print values
  cout << carObj1.brand << " " << carObj1.model << " " << carObj1.year << "\n";
  cout << carObj2.brand << " " << carObj2.model << " " << carObj2.year << "\n";
  return 0;
}
